ABOUT
  cowmilk is a tiny TCP/IP server with GTK+ user interface.

  You can start the server on any port and than wait for a client connections.
  When a client connects on this port, cowmilk pops up a chat dialog. The chat
  dialog consists of two parts: on the top there is a hexadecimal dump of the
  incoming/outgoing traffic, and there is an input area at the bottom.
  Everything you will type there in the hexadecimal format will be sent to the
  client as a TCP payload. And that's all.

  cowmilk was developed as a one-time solution and the code is not perfect.
  Do not judge it strictly :)

SUCCESS STORIES
  This application was originally developed and intented for the only purpose -
  I needed a tool for debugging SCEP client on hardware VoIP phones. Since
  March 2009 we have successfully emulated the required behavior for some times
  in order to reproduce the problems with cowmilk.


NAME
  The name was coined by my dear friends. Thanks them for the creative.
  To give a name to the program is always trouble for me.
